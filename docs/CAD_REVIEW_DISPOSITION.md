# CAD review disposition — 2026-09-06

## Merge policy: owner authorized these PRs to main

On 2026-09-06 (America/New_York), the owner requested: "commit these to main for the respective repo." This explicitly authorizes merging the current PR documents and their prerequisite integrity changes to main, resolving the earlier placement hold for these changes. The earlier cleanup is retained in history; this is a recorded exception/decision, not a blanket authorization to publish future private planning or technical material.

The PR is retargeted to main with its prerequisite integrity work included. Original sprint and CAD task ledgers remain unchanged: permission to merge does not mean any CAD, fabrication, calibration, disclosure review or experiment is completed. No withheld technical detail is restored. This decision authorizes normal checked PR merges, not a force-push, safety-gate bypass, purchase, hardware operation or paper/data publication.

## Accepted engineering amendments

Park CAD until the actual lab-box inventory and explicit owner promotion exist. Instantiate the existing section 3.1 contract instead of duplicating it; thermal/field verification remains separate.

Code-CAD/CI is now an explicit selected workflow and separately estimated task, not an already implemented test. Cross-ledger prerequisites are recorded in [CAD_DEPENDENCIES.json](https://github.com/500ft/sensor-enclosure-thermal-design/blob/2beffdf412e57145062994e5626863de80438016/docs/CAD_DEPENDENCIES.json); the embedded validator checks references and prevents a task entering todo/in_progress/done with unverified prerequisites. Checks establish metadata consistency, not authentic external approval.

## Inputs and limits

The pasted review was available and checked against local files/current PR heads. The two artifact attachment links in the user message were not available as local files; their additional unpasted punch-list items have not been claimed reviewed. No CAD models or scientific measurements were made in this amendment.
